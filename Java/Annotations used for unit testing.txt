@Before - executes before each test method
@After - excutes after each test method
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass
@Test  - use to write test case
@Ignore - used to ignore test case. will avoid test case execution
@Failure - used whenever we want a failure test case.

@Before and @After can be used on public, non-static methods only. 
We can't use them with private and static methods

@BeforeClass will execute only once before all test methods execution and 
@AfterClass - executes only once after all test methods.

assetSame() - it makes use of == for comparison
assertEquals

@Before and @After is preferable.

assertNotNull
assertNotSame
