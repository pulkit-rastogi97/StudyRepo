//Delete working at end

//Bug is when we backspace before operator like if the expression
was 12/6 and answer is 2. Then if we backspace 12 and make the expression
as /6 then also the answer remains same. 

//Inserting the element at any position and then
  evaluates the expression and change the ('in')
  ('out') fields as well as expression.

//Delete should work anywhere in the expression.

//Left right keys while using keyborad doesn't change the result

//If we first use calcy keys then select and backspace to empty 
    the input feild, then if you press C button then you gets 
    to know "BackSpace" gets appended to the expression

//Apply focus on ('in') field wherever necessary.

//Backspace is only working at end of the expression to change
    the result and expression.

//Implement regex to input only 0-9 and . / + - *

//Implement regex to match the expression, 
    if it contains any operators, then only the 'out'
    box should display the result.



Least Priority bugs::
    //Select and delete not working
    //Select and backspace not working



Resolved Bugs:: 
    //Expression 3+4+ is not evaluating
    //After getting results, you won't be able C key won't function
    //Malfunctioning of clear button
    //Keyboard operators not working
    //Backspace not working properly - if we press it 
    it gonna remove 2 characters from the ('in').value but the result in
    the ('out') field is intact.
    //Clear button and backspace not functioning together
    //Enter key not working : it should display the result.
