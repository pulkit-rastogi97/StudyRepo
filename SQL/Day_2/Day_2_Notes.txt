SS : second
AM/PM

$
9 any number

Multiple row functions
------------------------

--->
--->		Function	---> 1 value
--->
--->
--->

AVG(n)
SUM(n)
MAX(expr) - can accept character, number as well as date datatype column
MIN(expr) - can accept character, number as well as date datatype column
COUNT(expr) - can accept character, number as well as date datatype column


All the group functions ignore null values in the column

GROUP BY Clause
		to segregate data into multiple groups
Having clause
		to apply filter condition on grouped data



Conditional Expressions
----------------------------


To incorporate if-else logic within SQL query

- CASE Expression
	Simple Case Expression
	Searched Case Expression

- DECODE Function
			H W



COMBINING DATA
------------------

Set Operators
		- Combine the output of multiple queries
	- UNION - All rows selected by both the queries, excluding dup
	- UNION ALL - All rows selected  by both the queries;including dup
	- INTERSECT - all the rows common in both the queries output
	- MINUS - All rows selected by first query but not by second query

Guidelines - 
 Output will be sorted based on first column in the result; except in case of UNION ALL
Number of column selected by all the queries and their data type should match. column names can be different
Column names from the 1st query will appear in result set


select col1, col5 from table1
set operator
select col2, col5 from tbl2

output
	names : Col1, Col5

Joins
-------
		- Combine the data from multiple tables


Inner Join
		basic syntax
		ANSI stnd syntax
Cartesian product
Natural Join
Self Join
Outer Join





OUTER JOIN

	display matched as well as unmatched data

	Oracle prop
			(+)
	ANSI standard
			LEFT OUTER JOIN
			RIGHT OUTER JOIN
			FULL OUTER JOIN

Self Join

Joining a table to itself



	Emp id	Name	Manager id
	1	AAA		null
	2	Shubhangi	1
	3	Kalyani		2




Subqueries
-------------



Query within query
Query embedded within a clause of another query


Nested subquery
	- Inner query executes first
	- Output of inner query -> as input to Outer query
	- Outer query executes


 Single row subquery
	Inner query returns single value
	single row operators	= > < >= <= etc

 Multiple row subquery
	Inner query returns more than one value
	Multiple row operators	IN, NOT IN, ANY, ALL


Places where user can embedd subquery

Where clause .. select stmt
Having clause .. select stmt
FROM clause .. select stmt

Instead of Values clause of Insert statemet
Set clause of Update statement
Where clause of update statement
Where clause of Delete statement

Create table stmt




select ........
From ( subquery )

Subquery in FROM clause - INLINE View



Correlated Subquery

	- Outer query executes first
	- Inner query will execute for each row returned by outer query
	- Inner query contains some column from outer queries table


= > < >= <=

EXISTS, NOT EXISTS
